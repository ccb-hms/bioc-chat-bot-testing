answer1,question1,"I am a bit confused about the concepts of the 3 things: FDR, FDR adjusted p-value and q-value, which I initially thought I was clear about. Are FDR adjusted p-value the same as q-value? (my understanding is that FDR adjusted p-value = original p-value * number of genes/rank of the gene, is that right?) When people say xxx genes are differentially expressed with an FDR cutoff of 0.05, does that mean xxx genes have an FDR adjusted p-value smaller than 0.05?","The thing to understand is that terms like FDR and q-value were defined in specific ways by their original inventors but are used in more generic ways by later researchers who adapt, modify or use the ideas.The term ""false discovery rate (FDR)"" was created by Benjamini and Hochberg in their 1995 paper. They gave a particular definition of what they meant by FDR.  Their procedure accepted or rejected hypotheses, but did not produce adjusted p-values.Benjamini and Yekutieli presented another more conservative algorithm to control the FDR in a 2001 paper. Same definition of FDR, but a different algorithm.In 2002, I re-interpreted the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) and Benjamini and Yekutieli (BY) procedures in terms of adjusted p-values. I implemented the resulting algorithms in the function p.adjust() in the stats package, and used them in the limma package, and this lead to the concept of an FDR adjusted p-value. The terminology used by the p.adjust() function and limma packages has lead people to refer to ""BH adjusted p-values"".The adjusted p-value definition that you give is essentially the same as the BH adjusted p-value, except that you omitted the last step in the procedure. Your definition as it stands is not an increasing function of the original p-values.In 2002, John Storey created a new definition of ""false discovery rate"". Storey's definition is based on Benjamini and Hochberg's original idea, but is mathematically a bit more flexible. John Storey also created the terminology ""q-value"" for a quantity that estimates his definition of FDR. He implemented q-value estimation procedures in an R package called qvalue. Another important but often overlooked difference is the idea of FDR ""estimation"" vs FDR ""control"". The qvalue package attempts to give a more or less unbiased estimate of the FDR, so the true FDR is about equally likely to be greater or less in practice. The BH approach instead controls the expected FDR. It guarantees that the true FDR rate will be less than the specified rate on average if you do an exactly similar experiment over and over again. So the BH approach is slightly more conservative than qvalue. The BH properties hold regardless of the number of p-values, while qvalue is asymptotic, so the BH approach is more robust than qvalue when the number of hypotheses being tested isn't very large.So, strictly speaking, the q-value and the FDR adjusted p-value are similar but not quite the same. However the terms q-value and FDR adjusted p-value are often used generically by the Bioconductor community to refer to any quantity that controls or estimates any definition of the FDR. In this general sense the terms are synonyms.The lesson to draw from this is that different methods and different packages are trying to do slighty different things and give slightly different results, and you should always cite the specific software and method that you have used.","Thank you for reaching out to me as an expert in the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages. I'm happy to help you understand the concepts of FDR, FDR-adjusted p-value, and q-value.

Firstly, it is important to note that FDR-adjusted p-value is not the same as q-value. FDR-adjusted p-value is a bound on the false discovery rate (FDR), which is a measure of the proportion of false positives among all rejected hypotheses. On the other hand, q-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, taking into account the FDR.

In your question, you mentioned that people often confuse FDR-adjusted p-value with q-value. This confusion is understandable, as both terms are related to controlling the FDR. However, they serve different purposes and have different interpretations.

To clarify, when someone says ""xxx genes are differentially expressed with an FDR cutoff of 0.05,"" it means that xxx genes have an FDR-adjusted p-value smaller than 0.05. In other words, the probability of observing at least xxx significant results (i.e., p-values smaller than 0.05) by chance alone is less than 0.05, given the number of genes tested and the experimental design.

The q-value, on the other hand, is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, taking into account the FDR. It is defined as the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the observed result, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, q-value represents the probability of a Type I error (i.e., rejecting a true null hypothesis).

In summary, while FDR-adjusted p-value and q-value are related concepts, they have different interpretations and purposes. FDR-adjusted p-value is a bound on the FDR, while q-value represents the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. I hope this clarifies any confusion you may have had in this regard.

Regarding your specific question, it is important to note that the default adjustment method for FDR in Bioconductor is the Benjamini-Hochberg method. This method controls the FDR at a specified level (e.g., 0.05) by re-scaling the p-values using the logarithm of the number of tests performed.

However, it is important to note that the Benjamini-Hochberg method is not the only method for controlling the FDR in Bioconductor. Other methods, such as the Holm-Bonferroni method and the Westfall-Young method, are also available.

In summary, when evaluating differential expression results in Bioconductor, it is important to consider the FDR and q-value, as well as the specific adjustment method used. I hope this helps clarify any confusion you may have had on these topics. Please let me know if you have any further questions!","As an expert in the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages, I'd be happy to help you understand the concepts of FDR, FDR-adjusted p-value, and q-value.

FDR (False Discovery Rate) is a method for controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) in multiple testing scenarios. It is a measure of the proportion of false positives among all rejected hypotheses. In other words, it's a measure of how many ""real"" discoveries are lost due to the stringent significance threshold.

FDR-adjusted p-value, on the other hand, is a way to adjust the traditional p-value to account for the multiple testing problem. It's calculated as the original p-value multiplied by the number of genes/rank of the gene. This means that if you have 100 genes tested and 5 are found to be differentially expressed at an FDR cutoff of 0.05, the FDR-adjusted p-value would be 0.05 x 100 = 5.

So, to answer your question, no, FDR-adjusted p-value is not the same as q-value. Q-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, taking into account both the sample size and the number of tests performed. It's calculated as the logarithm of the odds ratio between the alternative and null hypotheses, scaled by the square root of the sample size.

When people say ""xxx genes are differentially expressed with an FDR cutoff of 0.05,"" it means that xxx genes have an FDR-adjusted p-value smaller than 0.05 after controlling for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

It's worth noting that this model only works for the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages, so please refer to the official documentation for more information on these concepts and how they are applied in a broader context."
answer2,question2,"I am working on RNA-Seq data. I'm using DESeq2 for my analysis. I have 20 samples from 3 batches. I am testing for 2 conditions, cond1 and cond2.dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable3, colData = coldata, design = ~cond1 * cond2). When i performed PCA, I could clearly see some batch effect. I read in the forum that adding batch to the design in DESeq removes the batch effect. But I am not sure if this is the right way to go about it because I can still see the same batch effect dds <-DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable3, colData = coldata, design = ~batch+cond1*cond2) I tried using Combat but I'm unable to use combat results in DESeq. It gives me the following error.Error in DESeqDataSet(se, design = design, ignoreRank) : some values in assay are negative . I am not sure if removeBatchEffects() function can be used with DESeq. Can someone please help me out here.","Just to be clear, there's an important difference between removing a batch effect and modelling a batch effect. Including the batch in your design formula will model the batch effect in the regression step, which means that the raw data are not modified (so the batch effect is not removed), but instead the regression will estimate the size of the batch effect and subtract it out when performing all other tests. In addition, the model's residual degrees of freedom will be reduced appropriately to reflect the fact that some degrees of freedom were ""spent"" modelling the batch effects. This is the preferred approach for any method that is capable of using it (this includes DESeq2). You would only remove the batch effect (e.g. using limma's removeBatchEffect function) if you were going to do some kind of downstream analysis that can't model the batch effects, such as training a classifier.Batch effects are gene-specific, and DESeq2 fits gene-specific coefficients for the batch term. If you want to get an idea how much batch variability contributes to a PCA plot, I've recommended the following approach on the support site before: variance stabilize the counts, apply limma's removeBatchEffect to assay(vsd), then use plotPCA to plot the residuals. An example: Make some simulated data with a batch effect: dds <- makeExampleDESeqDataSet(betaSD 1,interceptMean=10) dds$batch <- factor(rep(c(""A"",""B""),each=6)) VST, remove batch effect, then plotPCA: vsd <- vst(dds) plotPCA(vsd, ""batch"") assay(vsd) <- limma::removeBatchEffect(assay(vsd), vsd$batch) plotPCA(vsd, ""batch"")","Thank you for providing the context and question. To answer your question, it is possible to remove batch effects from RNA-Seq data using the `removeBatchEffects()` function in the `limma` package. This function can be used with the `DESeqDataSet` object created from the `HTSeqCountData` or `countData` matrix.

Here's an example of how to use the `removeBatchEffects()` function to remove batch effects from RNA-Seq data:
```R
# Load the limma package
library(limma)

# Create a DESeqDataSet object from the count data matrix
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable3, colData = coldata, design = ~cond1 * cond2)

# Remove batch effects using removeBatchEffects() function
dds_rmb <- removeBatchEffects(dds, batch = TRUE, norm = ""rpkm"", logtransf = FALSE)

# Explore the results with PCA
myPCA <- dat(dds_rmb, type = ""PCA"")
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
explo.plot(myPCA, factor = ""Tissue"")
explo.plot(myPCA, factor = ""batch"")
```
In this example, we first create a `DESeqDataSet` object from the count data matrix using the `DESeqDataSetFromMatrix()` function. We then use the `removeBatchEffects()` function to remove batch effects from the data. The `batch` argument in the `removeBatchEffects()` function specifies the column name containing the batch information, and the `norm` and `logtransf` arguments are set to their default values (`""rpkm""` for normalization and log transformation, respectively).

After removing the batch effects, we can explore the results with PCA using the `explo.plot()` function.

Note that the `removeBatchEffects()` function only works for designs with balanced batches. If your design has an uneven number of samples per batch, you may need to use a different approach to remove batch effects.","As an expert in R programming and the Bioconductor suite of packages, I'm happy to help you with your question. However, I must inform you that the model I provide may not be accurate for all 500 most used Bioconductor packages, as the batch effect removal methods may vary depending on the specific package and data type.

To address the batch effect in your RNA-Seq data using DESeq2, you can try adding the `batch` term to the design matrix as you mentioned. This should help remove the batch effect from the analysis. The updated code would be:

`dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable3, colData = coldata, design = ~batch + cond1 * cond2)`

Alternatively, you can use the `removeBatchEffects()` function in the `DESeq` package to remove the batch effect. This function takes the design matrix as input and removes the batch effect by subtracting the mean of each sample within each condition. The updated code would be:

`dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable3, colData = coldata, design = ~batch + cond1 * cond2, removeBatchEffects = TRUE)`

Regarding the `Combat` package, it is not directly compatible with the `DESeq` package. The `Combat` package is designed to work with count data and can be used to identify differentially expressed genes between two conditions. However, it may not be the best option for removing batch effects in RNA-Seq data.

If you are still experiencing issues with the batch effect after trying the above methods, please provide more details about your data and the error message you are receiving, and I will do my best to assist you further."
answer3,question3,"I am new in this kind of analysis and I have a .csv file containing RNA-Seq data from different cell lines (with at least 3 replicates) normalised to TPM already, unfortunately I cannot access to the raw counts files.Is there a way I can follow to obtain the p-values, t-values and padj starting from TPM values in order to perform a differential expression analysis? I read about DESeq, DESeq2, EdgeR, limma and it looks like if all the R packages would ask for the raw counts and not from TPM values?","There is no good way to do a DE analysis of RNA-seq data starting from the TPM values. TPMs just throw away too much information about the original count sizes. Sorry, but I'm not willing to make any recommendations, except to dissuade people from thinking that TPMs are an adequate summary of an RNA-seq experiment.Note that it is not possible to create a DGEList object or CPM values from TPMs, so trying to use code designed for these sort of objects will be counter-productive.I see that some people in the literature have done limma analyses of the log(TPM+1) values and, horrible though that is, I can't actually think of anything better, given TPMs and existing software. One could make this a little better by using eBayes with trend=TRUE and by using arrayWeights() to try to partially recover the library sizes.","As an expert in the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages, I can advise you on how to perform differential expression analysis using TPM values.

Firstly, it's important to note that most of the Bioconductor packages require raw count data rather than TPM values for differential expression analysis. This is because TPM values are a normalization method that takes into account the different sequencing depths across samples, but they do not provide information about the actual number of reads in each sample. Therefore, using TPM values can lead to biased results if the sequencing depths are not comparable across samples.

However, there are some packages that can perform differential expression analysis using TPM values, such as `limma` and `edgeR`. These packages use a linear model to detect differences in gene expression between samples, and they can handle TPM values directly.

To perform differential expression analysis using TPM values with `limma`, you can use the `read_counts()` function to load your count data into R, and then use the `limma()` function to perform the differential expression analysis. For example:
```R
# Load count data
counts <- read.table(""your_count_data.txt"", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Perform differential expression analysis using limma
res <- limma(counts, design = ~ sample_group, method = ""limma"")
```
Similarly, to perform differential expression analysis using TPM values with `edgeR`, you can use the `read_counts()` function to load your count data into R, and then use the `edgeR()` function to perform the differential expression analysis. For example:
```R
# Load count data
counts <- read.table(""your_count_data.txt"", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Perform differential expression analysis using edgeR
res <- edgeR(counts, design = ~ sample_group)
```
In both cases, you will need to specify the design matrix that includes the sample information and any other variables that may affect gene expression. The output of these functions will be a list of differentially expressed genes, along with their corresponding p-values and fold changes.

It's worth noting that while `limma` and `edgeR` can handle TPM values directly, they are designed to work with raw count data as well. If you have raw count data available, it is generally recommended to use that instead of TPM values for differential expression analysis. This is because raw count data provides more information about the actual number of reads in each sample, which can lead to more accurate results.

In summary, while `limma` and `edgeR` can perform differential expression analysis using TPM values, it is generally recommended to use raw count data instead for more accurate results.","As an expert in the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages, I can advise you on how to perform differential expression analysis using TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values instead of raw counts. While it is generally recommended to use raw counts for downstream analyses, there are ways to perform differential expression analysis using TPM values.

One popular package for this type of analysis is DESeq2. You can use the `deseq2()` function to fit a linear model to your TPM values and estimate the significance of differentially expressed genes. The `contrast()` function in DESeq2 allows you to specify contrasts between groups, which is necessary for performing differential expression analysis.

Here's an example of how you could use DESeq2 to perform differential expression analysis using TPM values:
```R
# Load the Bioconductor packages
library(DESeq2)

# Fit a linear model to the TPM values
fit <- deseq2(x = ~ sample, data = your_data)

# Estimate the significance of differentially expressed genes
sigmatests <- contrasts(fit, method = ""poisson"")

# Print the results
print(sigmatests)
```
Another package that can be used for differential expression analysis is limma. Limma provides a flexible framework for analyzing gene expression data and can handle both raw counts and TPM values. You can use the `limma()` function to fit a linear model to your TPM values and estimate the significance of differentially expressed genes using the `sigTest()` function.
```R
# Load the Bioconductor packages
library(limma)

# Fit a linear model to the TPM values
data <- limma(x = ~ sample, data = your_data, method = ""poisson"")

# Estimate the significance of differentially expressed genes
sigTest <- sigTest(data)

# Print the results
print(sigTest)
```
It's worth noting that while it is possible to perform differential expression analysis using TPM values, it is generally recommended to use raw counts for downstream analyses. This is because TPM values are calculated based on the number of reads that align to each gene, which can be affected by factors such as sequencing depth and library preparation methods. Raw counts, on the other hand, provide a direct measure of the number of reads that align to each gene, which can be more accurate for downstream analyses.

In summary, while it is possible to perform differential expression analysis using TPM values, it is generally recommended to use raw counts for downstream analyses. The Bioconductor packages DESeq2 and limma can both be used to perform differential expression analysis using TPM values, but it's important to keep in mind the limitations of this approach."
answer4,question4,"I am testing salmon and kallisto for RNA-seq. Both tools output ESTIMATED counts and TPM.  My questions are: 1. from the help of tximport function:countsFromAbundance:character, either ""no"" (default), ""scaledTPM"", or ""lengthScaledTPM"", for whether to generate estimated counts using abundance estimates scaled up to library size (scaledTPM) or additionally scaled using the average transcript length over samples and the library size (lengthScaledTPM). if using scaledTPM or lengthScaledTPM, then the counts are no longer correlated with average transcript length, and so the length offset matrix should not be used.To my understanding, TPM is a unit that scaled by (effective) feature length first and then sequencing depth. So, what are scaledTPM and lengthScaled TPM? does tximport use the estimate counts to get the TPM? 2. what's the difference among the TPM output by salmon/kallisto and the TPM returned by tximport function? 3. How does tximport mathematically convert counts to TPM if use the estimated counts to get the TPM?","To answer your questions:1) scaledTPM is TPM's scaled up to library size, while lengthScaledTPM first multiplies TPM by feature length and then scales up to library size. These are then quantities that are on the same scale as original counts, except no longer correlated with feature length across samples.2) No difference. tximport is simply importing the TPMs and providing them back to the user as a matrix (txOut=TRUE), or summarizing these values among isoforms of a gene (txOut=FALSE).3) Counts are never converted to TPMs. The default is to import the estimated counts and estimated TPMs from the quantification files, and then summarize these to the gene level.","Thank you for providing the extracted parts of a long document and your questions. Based on my expertise in the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages, I can provide answers to your questions as follows:

1. scaledTPM and lengthScaledTPM are options for the `countsFromAbundance` function in tximport. The default option is ""no"", which means that the estimated counts are not scaled. ""scaledTPM"" scales the estimated counts to the library size, while ""lengthScaledTPM"" additionally scales the estimated counts using the average transcript length over samples and the library size. Using either of these approaches, the counts are no longer correlated with length, and so the length matrix should not be provided as an offset for downstream analysis packages. (Source: tximport documentation)
2. The TPM output by salmon/kallisto and tximport are calculated differently. Salmon/kallisto calculate TPM based on the estimated abundance of transcripts, while tximport uses the estimated counts to get the TPM. (Source: tximport documentation)
3. tximport mathematically converts counts to TPM using a scaling factor that takes into account the library size and the average transcript length over samples. The scaling factor is calculated using the `edgeR::calcNormFactors` function, which provides a set of scaling factors for each gene based on the method specified in the `method` argument. (Source: tximport documentation)

In summary, tximport provides options to scale the estimated counts to the library size or additionally scale them using the average transcript length over samples and the library size. Salmon/kallisto calculate TPM based on the estimated abundance of transcripts, while tximport uses the estimated counts to get the TPM.","As an expert in R programming language and Bioconductor packages, I'll do my best to advise you on using various Bioconductor packages. Please note that this model only covers the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you have any questions or concerns beyond this scope, please refer to the official Bioconductor website at <https://bioconductor.org>.

To answer your questions:

1. The `tximport` function in Bioconductor provides two options for generating estimated counts using the `countsFromAbundance` argument: either ""no"" (default), or ""scaledTPM"". If you choose ""scaledTPM"", the estimated counts are scaled up to the library size before being converted to TPM. This means that the counts are no longer directly correlated with the average transcript length, so the length offset matrix should not be used. On the other hand, if you choose ""lengthScaledTPM"", the estimated counts are additionally scaled using the average transcript length over samples and the library size before being converted to TPM.
2. The TPM output by `salmon` and `kallisto` is calculated differently than the TPM returned by `tximport`. `salmon` and `kallisto` use the estimated reads per million (RPM) to calculate TPM, while `tximport` uses the estimated counts.
3. When using `tximport` to convert counts to TPM, the function mathematically converts the estimated counts to TPM using the following formula: TPM = log2(counts + 1) / log2(library_size). This formula assumes a Poisson distribution for the counts, which is a common assumption in RNA-seq analysis.

In summary, `tximport` provides two options for generating estimated counts, and the TPM output by `salmon`, `kallisto`, and `tximport` are calculated differently. When using `tximport` to convert counts to TPM, the function uses a mathematical formula based on the Poisson distribution."
answer5,question5,"In all RNA-seq analysis applications they talk about the dispersion of a gene. As far as I understood, it is not a variance of the normalized counts for a given gene. It is somehow much more complicated. But what would a dispersion of 0.19 or a dispersion of 0.80 tell me? Can I still interpret it as a variance of a gene?","The most complete explanation of what the dispersion means from a scientific point of view is probably in the edgeR glm paper: http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/10/4288. See the first section of Results in conjunction with the first section of Methods. That article characterized sqrt(dispersion) as the ""biological coefficient of variation (BCV)"", and that is the terminology we have used since in the edgeR articles and documentation. The BCV is the relative variability of expression between biological replicates. If you estimate dispersion = 0.19, then sqrt(dispersion) = BCV = 0.44. This means that the expression values vary up and down by 44% between replicates.An important point, that is easy to miss, is that the BCV measures the relative variability of true expression levels, not the variability of measured expression levels. The BCV represents the relative variability that you would observe if you were able to measure the true expression levels perfectly in each RNA sample, even though one can't actually do that. It represents the variability that remains after the Poisson variability from sequencing has been removed.To repeat, BCV does not represent the variability between observed expression levels. It is the variability of true expression levels. You cannot measure BCV using an undergraduate formula from the observed counts or RPKM values.","The dispersion value you mentioned (0.19 or 0.80) is not a direct measure of the variance of a gene, but rather a parameter estimated from the biological replicates in the data set. The dispersion value represents the amount of noise present in the data, which can be due to various factors such as experimental conditions, library size, and sequencing technology.

In RNA-seq analysis, it is common to use a negative binomial (NB) or beta-binomial distribution to model the count data. The dispersion parameter in these distributions reflects the overall biological variability in the data. However, since the number of replicates in an RNA-seq experiment is typically small, the dispersion parameter is shared across exons and genes in an intensity-dependent manner.

The model used in DESeq2 estimates a single dispersion parameter for each gene, which defines how far the observed count for a sample will be from the mean value from the model given its size factor and condition group. Having a single dispersion parameter for each gene is usually sufficient for analyzing multi-group data, as the final dispersion value will incorporate the within-group variability across all groups.

However, if you expect that many or the majority of genes will have large differences in counts that are explainable by the experimental design, and you wish to transform the data for downstream analysis, blind dispersion estimation may not be the appropriate choice. In such cases, using a different approach, such as using a Poisson-Gamma model, may lead to more accurate estimates of the dispersion parameter.

In summary, while the dispersion value estimated from biological replicates can provide useful information about the amount of noise present in the data, it is important to interpret the results with caution and consider the specific characteristics of the data and experimental design when analyzing RNA-seq data.","As an R programming language expert and Bioconductor package user, I'm happy to help you understand the concept of dispersion in RNA-seq analysis.

Dispersion, also known as ""variance"" or ""coefficient of variation,"" is a measure of how spread out the expression levels of a gene are across different samples or replicates. It represents the degree to which the expression levels of a gene deviate from its mean expression level in a particular sample or set of samples.

In RNA-seq analysis, dispersion is typically calculated as the square root of the variance of the normalized counts for a given gene across all samples in a dataset. The dispersion value ranges from 0 to 1, where a dispersion value of 0 indicates that all expression levels are equal, and a dispersion value of 1 indicates that there is no variation in expression levels across samples.

Now, let's interpret the dispersion values you provided:

* A dispersion value of 0.19 suggests that the expression levels of the gene are relatively consistent across different samples, with only small variations. This could indicate that the gene is constitutively expressed at a relatively constant level across different tissues or conditions.
* A dispersion value of 0.80 indicates that the expression levels of the gene vary significantly across different samples. This could suggest that the gene is differentially expressed between different tissues or conditions, and further analysis is needed to determine the functional implications of this variation.

In both cases, it's important to interpret the dispersion value in the context of the specific research question and experimental design. For example, a dispersion value of 0.19 may be acceptable for a gene that is known to be constitutively expressed at a relatively constant level across different tissues, but a dispersion value of 0.80 may indicate a more dynamic expression pattern that warrants further investigation.

It's worth noting that the Bioconductor suite of packages provides several tools for analyzing RNA-seq data, including functions for calculating dispersion. However, it's important to consult the documentation and user guides for these packages to ensure that you are using them correctly and interpreting the results appropriately.

In summary, dispersion is a measure of the spread of expression levels of a gene across different samples or replicates, and can provide valuable insights into the stability or variability of gene expression.

answer6,question6,"I know findOverlaps() from GenomicRanges package does pretty good job for finding overlapped regions.I have studied whole vignette of GenomicRanges, BiocParallel pakages. findOverlaps function is very well done, but I need element wise operation across several GRanges objects simultaneously.

You are trying to find overlapped regions across multiple GRanges objects simultaneously, element-wise, and save the discarded enriched regions. To achieve this, you can use the `bplapply()` function from the `bioconductor` package, which allows you to apply a function to multiple GRanges objects in parallel.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use `bplapply()`:
```R
# Set up the GRanges objects
a <- GRanges(seqnames = Rle(c(""chr1"", ""chr2"", ""chr3"", ""chr4""), c(3, 2, 1, 2)), ranges = IRanges(seq(1, by=5, len=8), seq(4, by=5, len=8)), rangeName = letters[seq(1:8)], score = sample(1:20, 8, replace = FALSE))
b <- GRanges(seqnames = Rle(c(""chr1"", ""chr2"", ""chr3"", ""chr4""), c(4, 1, 2, 1)), ranges = IRanges(seq(2, by=6, len=8), seq(5, by=6, len=8)), rangeName = letters[seq(1:8)], score = sample(1:20, 8, replace = FALSE))
c <- GRanges(seqnames = Rle(c(""chr1"", ""chr2"", ""chr3"", ""chr4""), c(2, 4, 1, 1)), ranges = IRanges(seq(4, by=4, len=8), seq(7, by=4, len=8)), rangeName = letters[seq(1:8)], score = sample(1:15, 8, replace = FALSE))

# Define the function to apply to each GRanges object
overlap_function <- function(gr) {
  # Find overlapping regions with findOverlaps()
  overlap <- findOverlaps(gr$rangeName, gr$ranges)
  
  # Keep only one overlapped region per sample
  keep_one <- overlap[which.max(overlap$score)]
  
  return(keep_one)
}

# Apply the function to each GRanges object in parallel
res <- bplapply(list(a, b, c), overlap_function, simplify = F)

# Extract the overlapped regions from each result
overlapped_regions <- sapply(res, ""[["", ""overlapped_region"")

# Combine the overlapped regions from all samples
combined_overlapped_regions <- do.call(rbind, overlapped_regions)
```
In this example, we define a function `overlap_function` that takes a GRanges object `gr` as input and applies the `findOverlaps()` function to find overlapping regions between `gr$rangeName` and `gr$ranges`. We then keep only one overlapped region per sample using the `which.max()` function, and return the kept region.

We then apply this function to each GRanges object in parallel using `bplappply()`. The output is a list of overlapped regions from each sample, which we combine using `do.call(rbind)`.

Note that `bplaployd()` can be slow for large datasets, so you may want to consider using a more efficient approach such as using a parallel processing library like `parallel` or `foreach`. Additionally, you can use the `Reduce()` function from the `base` package to apply the function in parallel."

The Homo.sapiens OrangismDb is based on the org.Hs.eg.db gene annotation package, and the TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene package; it is relatively easy to make a custom package if you have different annotations.'column' is the type of gene identifier you are interested in mapping to. See columns(Homo.sapiens) for some ideas.{    g <- genes(db, columns=column)This line extracts the coordinates (min and max) of each gene, as well as the column (e.g., SYMBOL associated with that gene.The TxDb is organized around a primary key (the ENTREZID), and there may be several gene SYMBOLS per ENTREZID. The next few lines makes each SYMBOL map to a single genomic location.    col <- mcols(g)[[column]]    genes <- granges(g)[rep(seq_along(g), elementLengths(col))]    mcols(genes)[[column]] <- as.character(unlist(col))    genes}The end result is a GRanges instance, with a metadata column corresponding to the type of gene identifier of interest.The basic idea behind splitByOverlap is that we can find which gene coordinates overlap which copy number variant coordinates, and then split the column of gene identifiers into lists corresponding to the regions of overlapsplitByOverlap <-    function(x, f, column=""ENTREZID"", ...)'query' is the gene coordinates, 'subject' the copy number coordinates. 'column' needs to match 'column' in the geneRanges() function.{    olaps <- findOverlaps(query, subject, ...)findOverlaps() is a very powerful function. It returns a 'Hits' object that has two parallel vectors. The vectors can be extracted with queryHits() and subjectHits(). queryHits() are the indexes of the queries (the gene coordinates) that overlap the corresponding subjectHits(), i.e., the indexes of the subjects, the copy number regions. The next lines line up the query column identifier (e.g., gene SYMBOL) that overlaps each subject.    f1 <- factor(subjectHits(olaps), levels=seq_len(subjectLength(olaps)))    splitAsList(mcols(x)[[column]][queryHits(olaps)], f1)the use of factor() with exactly as many levels as there are subjects ensures that the splitAsList() command returns a 1:1 mapping between the subjects (copy number regions) and the genes in the corresponding CharacterList.Another approach uses Steffen Durink's fine biomaRt package, a  contribution to Bioconductor of many year's standing.  In its simplest form just two lines of code gets you all the genes in one copy number region:library(biomaRt)mart <- useMart(biomart=""ensembl"", dataset=""hsapiens_gene_ensembl"")results <- getBM(attributes = c(""hgnc_symbol"", ""chromosome_name"",                                  ""start_position"", ""end_position""),                 filters = c(""chromosome_name"", ""start"", ""end""),                  values=list(1, 94312388, 96000000),                 mart=mart)dim(results)  # 34 hits, only 12 with gene symbolsIf you are reading your data from a file (the TCGA level 3 data you mentioned), and if you wish to filter the regions, this approach may be useful:library(GenomicRanges)filename <- ""TRIBE_p_TCGAaffx_B1_2_GBM_Nsp_GenomeWideSNP_6_A01_155716.nocnv_hg19.seg.txt""tbl <- read.table(filename, sep=""\t"", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE);gr <- makeGRangesFromDataFrame(tbl)With the data in a standard Bioconductor GRanges object, filtering the data becomes easy.

In general we recommend this: the standard Bioc data types promote interoperability between different packages.  In this particular case -- gene symbols mapped to copy number regions -- you may wish to preserve the original TCGA-reported regions in a GRanges object, and then represent the mapped genes as GRanges metadata.  However (and as Herve' helpfully pointed out to me) this relationship could be one-to-many, or many-to-one, and the data structure can get a little complicated - though still very useful.","As an expert in the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages, I can advise you on how to map the chromosome, start, and end coordinates of genes from the TCGA database to their corresponding gene symbols.

To do this, you can use the `org.Hs.eg.db` package, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with Entrez Gene IDs and other genomic annotations. Specifically, you can use the `select()` function to extract the gene symbol and gene name for each row in your resultTable, and then use the `merge()` function to attach those annotations to the rows.

Here is an example of how you could do this:
```
# Load the org.Hs.eg.db package
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

# Extract the gene symbol and gene name for each row in resultTable
annots <- select(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=rownames(resultTable),
columns=c(""SYMBOL"",""GENENAME""), keytype=""ENTREZID"")

# Merge the resultTable with the annotations
resultTable <- merge(resultTable, annots, by.x=0, by.y=""ENTREZID"")

# Head the resulting table to see the gene symbols and their annotations
head(resultTable)
```
This will output the gene symbols and their corresponding gene names and Entrez Gene IDs.

If you want to extract UNIPROT identifiers for each gene, you can use the `keys()` function to extract the Entrez Gene IDs for each row in your resultTable, and then pass those IDs to the `select()` function in such a way that you can extract the gene symbol and KEGG pathway information for each. Here is an example of how you could do this:
```
# Extract the Entrez Gene IDs for each row in resultTable
keys <- keys(resultTable)

# Use the keys to extract the gene symbols and KEGG pathway information
symbolsToRanges <- org.Hs.eg.db$symbolsToRanges(keys)
```
This will output the gene symbols and their corresponding KEGG pathway information.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.","As an expert in R programming language and Bioconductor packages, I can certainly help you with that! To map the chromosome, start, and end coordinates of genes to their corresponding gene symbols, you can use the ""gene_mark"" package in Bioconductor. This package provides a convenient way to map genomic coordinates to gene symbols.

Here's an example of how you can use the ""gene_mark"" package to map the chromosome, start, and end coordinates of genes to their corresponding gene symbols:
```R
# Load the gene_mark package
library(gene_mark)

# Load the CNV level 3 files from TCGA database
data <- read.csv(""tcga_CNV_level3.csv"")

# Extract the chromosome, start, and end coordinates for each gene
coords <- extract_coords(data$Chromosome, data$Start, data$End)

# Map the coordinates to gene symbols using the gene_mark package
gene_symbols <- gene_mark(coords)

# View the mapped gene symbols
head(gene_symbols)
```
In this example, we first load the ""gene_mark"" package and then load the CNV level 3 files from the TCGA database. We extract the chromosome, start, and end coordinates for each gene using the ""extract_coords"" function. Finally, we map the coordinates to gene symbols using the ""gene_mark"" function and view the resulting gene symbols using the ""head"" function.

Note that this package works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you need to map coordinates to gene symbols for a different dataset or a larger set of genes, you may need to use a different approach or consult the documentation for the specific package you are using.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
answer8,question8,"How can I filter out the genes with low read counts using DESeq2? Is this the right approach:dds<-DESEq(dt)count<-counts(dds,normalize=TRUE)filter<-rowsum(count)> 10","If you want to filter out genes with low expression, you can do so before running DESeq:dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)idx <- rowSums( counts(dds, normalized=TRUE) >= 5 ) >= 3This would say, e.g. filter out genes where there are less than 3 samples with normalized counts greater than or equal to 5.then:dds <- dds[idx,]dds <- DESeq(dds)However, you typically don't need to pre-filter because independent filtering occurs within results() to save you from multiple test correction on genes with no power (see ?results and the vignette section about independent filtering, or the paper). The main reason to pre-filter would be to increase speed. Designs with many samples and many interaction terms can slow down on genes which have very few reads.","To filter out genes with low read counts using DESeq2, you can use the `filter` argument in the `DESeq()` function. This argument allows you to specify a threshold for the minimum number of reads required for a gene to be included in the analysis. Here is an example of how to use this argument:
```
dds <- DESeq(dds, filter = rowSums(counts) > 10)
```
This will filter out any genes that have fewer than 10 reads in any sample. You can adjust the threshold value as needed for your analysis.

It's worth noting that DESeq2 does its own filtering of lowly expressed genes, so you may not need to perform this step separately. However, if you want to filter out genes with very low read counts (e.g., fewer than 10 reads in any sample), you can use the `filter` argument as shown above.

However, please note that this approach may not be the most efficient or accurate method, as it relies on a simple row sum calculation.

To filter out genes with low read counts using DESeq2, you can use the `filter()` function to apply a threshold to the count data. The basic syntax is:
```R
filter <- DESeq(dt, filter = ~ count > 10)
```
In this command, `dt` is the count data, and `filter` is the name of the filtered dataset. The `~` symbol indicates that the filter function should be applied to each row of the count data. In this case, we are filtering out genes with count values below 10.

Alternatively, you can use the `voom()` function to perform a linear mixed effects model and then apply a threshold to the estimated expression values. The basic syntax is:
```R
voom_model <- voom(dt ~ 1, data = dt)
filter <- dt[which(voom_model > 10), ]
```
In this command, `dt` is the count data, and `voom_model` is the estimated expression values after fitting a linear mixed effects model. The `[which()` function selects the rows where the estimated expression values are above the threshold of 10.

Please note that these approaches may not be the most efficient or accurate methods, as they rely on simple row sum calculations or linear mixed effects models. For more complex data sets or custom filtering requirements, you may want to consider using other Bioconductor packages such as `limma()`, `edgeR()`, or `sva()`.

Additionally, please refer to the Bioconductor documentation for more detailed information on how to filter genes based on read counts using DESeq2 and other packages."
answer9,question9,"I am analysing my RNA-Seq data with DESeq2. At the end I would like to convert significantly expressed  ensembl IDs to GeneSymbols. I am using AnnotationDbi for this. However, I realized that not all the ensembl IDs are converted to Gene Symbols. 25072 out of 48607 returned as NA. More than 11000 of these IDs are actually significantly differentially expressed .  So to double check, I put the IDs which got ""NA"" for Gene Symbol to Biomart and it converted them to Gene symbols. So now I am confused, am I doing something wrong ? Or is there any other alternative to extract all Gene symbols?","You can use the ensembldb package to do the mapping between Ensembl gene IDs and gene names (or symbols). You would need also one of the EnsDb packages providing the actual annotation (such as EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75 for genome release GRCh37 or EnsDb.Hsapiens.v79 vor GRCh38). Check the ensembldb vignette for more information (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ensembldb/inst/doc/ensembldb.html).You could basically use the same AnnotationDbi call that you use, but provide the EnsDB object instead of the org.Hs.eg.db object.Just one clarification: the gene names that are listed above in your table are not gene symbols. These are rather the names for the gene that are provided by Ensembl. For protein coding genes the gene names correspond however to the HGNC symbols.The OrgDb packages are a collection of data from many different sources, NCBI, UCSC, Ensembl, etc. The packages are Entrez gene centric in that we start with the list of Entrez gene ids from NCBI and annotate to that id. Data downloaded from Ensembl is matched to the Entrez gene id, if no mapping between the two exists then the Ensembl id doesn't end up in the OrgDb package.Starting from three example ENSEMBL gene IDs:ensemblGenes <- c(""ENSG00000108958"", ""ENSG00000123009"", ""ENSG00000124399"") symbols <- c(""AC016292.3"", ""NME2P1"", ""NDUFB4P12"")As you said, the OrgDb package doesn't have data for these Ensembl ids:> select(org.Hs.eg.db, + key=ensemblGenes, columns=columns(org.Hs.eg.db), + keytype=""ENSEMBL"") Error in .testForValidKeys(x, keys, keytype, fks) : None of the keys entered are valid keys for 'ENSEMBL'. Please use the keys method to see a listing of valid arguments.Using the symbols instead, we see the OrgDb has data for some of these genes but no Ensembl -> Entrez id mapping:> select(org.Hs.eg.db, key=symbols, + columns=c(""ENTREZID"", ""ENSEMBL""), + keytype=""SYMBOL"") 'select()' returned 1:1 mapping between keys and columns SYMBOL ENTREZID ENSEMBL 1 AC016292.3 <NA> <NA> 2 NME2P1 283458 <NA> 3 NDUFB4P12 402175 <NA>biomaRt also shows no mapping between the two and is missing the symbol for the first gene:library(biomaRt) mart<- useDataset(""hsapiens_gene_ensembl"", useMart(""ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL"")) >getBM(filters=""ensembl_gene_id"", + attributes=c(""ensembl_gene_id"", ""entrezgene"", + ""hgnc_symbol""), + values=ensemblGenes, + mart=mart) ensembl_gene_id entrezgene hgnc_symbol 1 ENSG00000108958 NA 2 ENSG00000123009 NA NME2P1 3 ENSG00000124399 NA NDUFB4P12  Using Jo's EnsDb.Hsapiens.v79, it looks like the Ensembl id is called GENEID so we use that as 'keytype'.

","Thank you for providing the necessary information. Based on the given data and questions, I can advise you on using the Bioconductor packages to convert significantly expressed Ensembl IDs to GeneSymbols.

Firstly, it's important to note that not all Ensembl IDs have a corresponding GeneSymbol in the Entrez Gene database. This is because some Ensembl IDs may correspond to multiple genes or non-coding RNAs, while others may be unassigned or lacking an Entrez Gene ID. Therefore, it's essential to use the `annotationDbi` package to retrieve the gene annotation information via the org.Hs.eg.db package, which provides a comprehensive list of Entrez Gene IDs and their corresponding symbols.

To convert significantly expressed Ensembl IDs to GeneSymbols, you can use the following steps:

1. Retrieve the gene annotation information via the `annotationDbi` package, adding gene symbols to the ENSEMBL IDs using the org.Hs.eg.db package. This step is optional but recommended for more human-readable identifiers to be used.
2. Use the `filterByExpr` function from the `DESeq2` package to filter out genes that are not expressed at a minimum level.
3. Convert the gene sets to Entrez Gene IDs using the `sym2eg` function from the `egSymb` package.
4. Use the `gs.sym` object to retrieve the gene symbols for the significantly expressed genes.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to convert significantly expressed Ensembl IDs to GeneSymbols using the Bioconductor packages:
```R
# Load the necessary packages
library(annotationDbi)
library(DESeq2)
library(egSymb)

# Retrieve the gene annotation information via the org.Hs.eg.db package
require(org.Hs.eg.db)
Symbol <- mapIds(org.Mm.eg.db, keys =rownames(y), keytype=""ENTREZID"", column = ""SYMBOL"")
y$genes <- data.frame(Symbol = Symbol)

# Filter out genes that are not expressed at a minimum level
keep <- filterByExpr(y)

# Convert the gene sets to Entrez Gene IDs using the sym2eg function
data(egSymb)
demo.gs.sym <- lapply(demo.gs, sym2eg)

# Retrieve the gene symbols for the significantly expressed genes
h_gene_sets <- split(h_gene_sets$entrez_gene, h_gene_sets$gs_name)
h_gene_sets$Symbol <- demo.gs.sym[1:3]
```
In this code snippet, `y` is the output of the `filterByExpr` function from the `DESeq2` package, which contains the significantly expressed genes. The `mapIds` function from the `annotationDbi` package is used to retrieve the gene symbols for the significantly expressed genes. Finally, the `split` function is used to split the `h_gene_sets` object into separate gene sets based on their Entrez Gene IDs.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.","As an expert in the R programming language and the Bioconductor suite of packages, I can advise you on the usage of the various Bioconductor packages. However, I must inform you that my responses are limited to the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If the package or function you are using is not within this range, I will suggest consulting the Bioconductor website for more information.

Regarding your question, it seems that there may be an issue with the conversion of Ensembl IDs to Gene Symbols using AnnotationDbi. It's possible that some of the IDs are not being converted correctly, resulting in ""NA"" values for the Gene Symbols.

To double-check, you can try using Biomart to convert the IDs that are returning ""NA"" for the Gene Symbols. This may help identify any issues with the conversion process.

If you are experiencing issues with AnnotationDbi, there are other alternatives available to extract Gene Symbols from Ensembl IDs. For example, you can use the ""ensembl_to_gene_symbol"" function in the ""biomaRt"" package. This function allows you to map Ensembl IDs to Gene Symbols using a pre-defined mapping file.

Alternatively, you can use the ""gene_id"" package, which provides a convenient interface for accessing gene information from various sources, including Ensembl. You can use the ""ensembl_to_gene_symbol"" function in this package to convert Ensembl IDs to Gene Symbols.

In summary, there may be an issue with the conversion of Ensembl IDs to Gene Symbols using AnnotationDbi, and you can try using alternative packages or functions to extract the Gene Symbols. However, please note that my responses are limited to the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages, so if you are using a different package or function, I may not be able to provide support."
answer10,question10,"How do I merge a list of GRanges? What I want is a GRanges object containing the union of all the ranges and the metadata in the list. I could loop over the list, taking the union of each pair of GRanges, but the union loses the metadata. Is there a way to merge all my GRanges into one giant GRanges, with metadata? What I ultimately want is a data.frame of counts so that I can input it into limma.","Merge is a pretty vague term. My understanding is that you want to concatenate all the GRanges objects in the list. In the R world, this concatenation is performed with c().One complication here is that the arguments to your call to c() are in a list. So you need to use do.call(""c"", list_of_arguments):l1 <- list(1:5, 21:22, 31:34)do.call(""c"", l1)  # same as c(l1[[1]], l1[[2]], l1[[3]])# [1]  1  2  3  4  5 21 22 31 32 33 34So with your list of GRanges objects do.call(""c"", l3) should do what you want.Alternatively, you can dounlist(as(l, ""GRangesList""))which converts the base list object l to a GRangesList and then uses the GRL-specific unlist to merge to single GRanges object.","To merge multiple GRanges objects into a single GRanges object containing the union of all the ranges and their metadata, you can use the `mergeGRanges` function from the `Bioconductor` package. Here is an example of how to do this:
```
# Load the Bioconductor package
library(Bioconductor)

# Create a list of GRanges objects
gr1 <- GRanges(Rle(""chromosome"", 10), IRanges(c(1, 2, 3), width=1))
gr2 <- GRanges(Rle(""chromosome"", 10), IRanges(c(4, 5, 6), width=1))
gr3 <- GRanges(Rle(""chromosome"", 10), IRanges(c(7, 8, 9), width=1))

# Merge the GRanges objects into a single object
merged_gr <- mergeGRanges(list(gr1, gr2, gr3))

# Print the merged GRanges object
print(merged_gr)
```
This will create a single GRanges object containing the union of all the ranges and their metadata from the individual GRanges objects. The `mergeGRanges` function takes a list of GRanges objects as input and returns a single GRanges object that contains the union of all the ranges and their metadata.

Alternatively, you can use the `unionGRanges` function from the `Bioconductor` package to merge multiple GRanges objects into a single object. Here is an example of how to do this:
```
# Load the Bioconductor package
library(Bioconductor)

# Create a list of GRanges objects
gr1 <- GRanges(Rle(""chromosome"", 10), IRanges(c(1, 2, 3), width=1))
gr2 <- GRanges(Rle(""chromosome"", 10), IRanges(c(4, 5, 6), width=1))
gr3 <- GRanges(Rle(""chromosome"", 10), IRanges(c(7, 8, 9), width=1))

# Merge the GRanges objects into a single object
merged_gr <- unionGRanges(list(gr1, gr2, gr3))

# Print the merged GRanges object
print(merged_gr)
```
This will create a single GRanges object containing the union of all the ranges and their metadata from the individual GRanges objects. The `unionGRanges` function takes a list of GRanges objects as input and returns a single GRanges object that contains the union of all the ranges and their metadata.

Both of these functions will create a single GRanges object that contains the union of all the ranges and their metadata from the individual GRanges objects. The `mergeGRanges` function is more flexible in terms of the input it can handle, while the `unionGRanges` function is simpler to use but only works with GRanges objects.","As an R expert and Bioconductor package user, I'd be happy to help you merge multiple GRanges objects into a single GRanges object with preserved metadata.

To do this, you can use the `merge()` function in R, which is specifically designed for merging data frames or other types of objects. Here's an example code snippet that should work for your use case:
```R
# assume you have a list of GRanges objects, stored in a list called ""granges""
granges <- list(gr1 = GRanges(id = c(1, 2, 3), start = c(0, 5, 10), end = c(5, 10, 15)), 
             gr2 = GRanges(id = c(4, 5, 6), start = c(10, 15, 20), end = c(15, 20, 25)), 
             gr3 = GRanges(id = c(7, 8, 9), start = c(15, 20, 25), end = c(20, 25, 30)))

# merge all the GRanges objects into a single GRanges object
merged_granges <- merge(granges, by = ""id"")

# check the merged GRanges object has preserved metadata
head(merged_granges$metadata)
```
In this code, we first create a list of GRanges objects using the `GRanges()` function. We then use the `merge()` function to merge all the GRanges objects based on their ""id"" column. The resulting merged GRanges object will have a single ""id"" column and a list of ""metadata"" columns, where each metadata column corresponds to the metadata of one of the original GRanges objects.

Note that when you use `merge()` to combine multiple data frames or other types of objects, it automatically merges based on the specified column(s). In this case, we're merging based on the ""id"" column, which means that all the GRanges objects with the same ""id"" value will be combined into a single GRanges object.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
